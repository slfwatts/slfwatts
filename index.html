        <p>
Steam is a video game distribution platform that is used by millions of people world wide, allowing access to an online collection of games nearly unequaled by any other distributors. With thousands of players using thousands of games, it is the go to choice for the vast majority of gamers worldwide.  
       </p>
       <p>
         Though this is a site showing my collection on steam, there are still a variety of other video game platforms that I make use of, though not to the same extent as steam itself.

       <h3>
         U Play
       </h3>
       <img src="images/uplaylogo.png" alt="U Play" style="width:100px;height:100px;" >
       <p>
         U Play is a video game platform run and owned by Ubisoft. Unlike Steam, which merely hosts other developers, all the games on U play have been produced and developed by Ubisoft itself. This leads to a limited number of games when compared to steam, but also allows for interconnectability between different games fom the same developer.
       </p>
       
       
       <h3>
         Battle Net
       </h3>
       <img src="images/battlenetlogo.jpg" alt="Battle Net" style="width:100px;height:100px;" >
       <p>
         Similar to U Play, Battle Net is owned and run by Blizzard, using the platform as a host for its many various games, though they have partnered with Activision to allow there games to be hosted via Battle Net also.
       </p>
       
       <h3>
      Origin
    </h3>
    <img src="images/originlogo.png" alt="Origin" style="width:100px;height:100px;" >
    <p>
      Just like the others, Origin focuses onh osting its own developed games, those created by EA. They do occasionally work with other studios, but the vast majority of games available on Origin are those developed by Electronic Arts, and are therefore not worth buying.

        <h2>Variety of Genres</h2>
        <h3><!--all input in this section is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres-->
          Action games
        </h3>

<p>
Action games emphasize physical challenges that require Hand-eye coordination and motor skill to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.

Action games are classified by many subgenres. Platform games and fighting games are among the best-known subgenres, while shooter games became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s. Action games usually involve elements of twitch gameplay.        
        </p>   
        <h3>
          Action-adventure
        </h3>
      <p>
Action-adventure games combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. "Action-adventure" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre. Because of their prevalence on video game consoles and the absence of typical adventure games, action-adventure games are often called "adventure games" by modern gamers.       
        </p>
        <h3>
Adventure
        </h3>
        <p>
Adventure games were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply "Adventure," and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.

Unlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a "purist" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a mini game.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>
          Role Playing
        </h3>
        <p>
          Role-playing video games draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more "adventurers" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or casting magic spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an overworld, usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable home computers coincided with the popularity of paper and pencil role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of experience points, have been widely adapted to other genres such as action-adventure games. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were turn-based games, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the strategy game's trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of Square's (now Square Enix's) Final Fantasy IV, the first game to use the Active Time Battle system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time role-playing games such as the Mana series, Soul Blazer and Ultima VII. Some throwbacks to older turn-based system did exist such as the Golden Sun series for Game Boy Advance.

I first installed steam on a laptop, in March 2015. Dota 2 was the first game I ever played via steam, being free to play and having been strongly recommended by several of my friends. Though I play a variety of different genres and games, Dota 2 is still the one I play the most, and have put the most time into, equating to over 100 days of straight gameplay over 4 years. After all this time, I have 102 games on steam alone, and a combined value of 6864 Hours of gameplay. This means that on steam games alone I have spent 286 days straight.
